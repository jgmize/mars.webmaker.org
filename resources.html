        <h1>Create your own lesson plan</h1>
        <p>
        We believe that the best way to learn is through active construction. Web multimedia is an exciting way to engage with the concepts presented here, and the <a href="https://webmaker.org/starter-makes">Webmaker tools</a> make it easy to create webpages, videos, animated dioramas, and other interactive media. We encourage you to:
          <ul>
            <li>Use Thimble <a href="https://webmaker.org/teach-templates">to create your own lesson plan for your learners</a>, and</li>
            <li>Help your learners build their own makes using the assets used in production, and from multimedia they find across the web (images, sounds, videos, models, links—really anything!) </li>
          </ul> 
          <p>
          The Mission to Mars units can be an anchor activity or starting point in many lesson plans. And you can form a response activity that challenges learners to explore the web and channel their research into a web project. For instance, you can ask learners to:</p>

          <ul>
          <li> restate what they've learned in a video presentation, using Popcorn;</li>
          <li>create an interactive poster using Thimble; </li>
          <li>anything, really. You can make anything you can imagine with the web. <a href="https://webmaker.org/starter-makes">Explore the starter makes for inspiration</a>—but remember, these templates are just starting points!</li>

          <h1>Bonus: WebGL and 3D content on the Web</h1>
          <p>WebGL is an awesome technology that brings 3D to the web. We built these experiences in WebGL using an open source library called Three.js. Because all of the code is open source, these units are not only a great tool for teaching key science concepts—they can also be a playground for learning about 3D graphics. Learn about the possibilities of 3D on the web in the <a href="https://mozillaignite.org/resources/labs/future-uses-of-webgl/">Mozilla Ignite Learning Lab on WebGL</a>.Here are some resources to get started with 3D content in the browser:

        <h1>Project Background</h1>
        <div style="font-size: small;">
        <p>Conventional, classroom-education has benefitted greatly from the advances in computing and information technology, yet this advantage is double-edged.  Because the evolution of these technological advances typically outpaces the ability of the classroom-based educational paradigm to incorporate them, most instructional and informational media is non-interactive, static, and fails to capture the level of personal/ participatory engagement of even the most rudimentary contemporary entertainment and social media.  This is compounded by the reality that domestic performance in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) fields has been steadily declining, and the identification of novel methods to address and reinvigorate students in STEAM fields are paramount.  In this light, developing techniques for quickly and efficiently integrating modern, 3D educational simulations into classroom, informal education and entertainment/social media environments, along with a means to validate a user’s use of them, is of great potential value.</p>
        <h2>Web-based science learning environments</h2> 
        <p>Based on ubiquitous improvements in computational processing power and bandwidth, it is now possible to create web-based, “hard” scientific engaging 3D STEAM simulations with the capability of serving as educationally-accurate, scripted or unscripted virtual experiences.  These Based on the increasing availability of Internet access in the classroom, this streamlines the incorporation of simulator content into the classroom environment.  Simultaneously, the increasingly availability of Internet access in the home affords students the opportunity to explore simulated environments informally, possibly attached to the educational system in an “extra-credit” context.  Concurrently, badging protocols, such a Mozilla Open Badges, addresses the issue of accountability by enabling STEM simulator designers to both stimulate user engagement, (i.e., the “award” effect and peer-based competition), as well as to communicate user progress and validate content completion to peers and educators.  Together, this serves to correct one of the greatest current failings of the educational paradigm, which is an inability to afford students the opportunity to explore content at their own pace, at their interest & convenience, in an authenticated environment.</p> 
        <h2>Simulation</h2>
        <p>A strength of virtual simulations is the intrinsic capability of affording users the ability to interact with complex or otherwise inaccessible environments in a tangible way.  In the case of the Solar System and Mars Rover simulators developed by MX Studio, it enables users the ability to engage in the lightly-scripted, guided exploration of scientifically-accurate, astronomical, geological, astrophysical, and life science concepts on Earth, Mars, and beyond.Leveraging digital assets available from NASA/JPL, commercial space exploration companies (Space X, Boeing, ULA, Bigelow Aerospace, etc.) and institutes of higher education, such simulations can be sure to adhere to the most rigorous and up-to-date scientific and technical information standards available.  Secondly, by incorporating task-based challenges into the science simulator, which itself may be considered a virtual learning environment, the completion of this content can be validated and communicated via the integration of awarded badges.</p>
